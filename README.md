# pgvector + python

## How to run this

Firstly, clone the repo using the command below

```
git clone git@github.com:bruno-braga/pgvector-docker.git
cd pgvector-docker
```

After inside the folder do

```
docker-compose up -d
```

Then the images will be downloaded and the containers will be up.

Also, initpgvector.sql will create the extension properly onto the DB_DATABASE and also add a table with some data as example.
